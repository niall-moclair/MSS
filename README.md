The following files are supplementary materials for the research project: 'Identification of Common Terminology for the Research Area of Mathematics and Statistics Support'.

Interview_Australia.pptx, Interview_Ireland.pptx, Interview_UK.pptx, Interview_USA.pptx (Section 4.5, page 12): These are the slides used to present the major survey results to the four interview participants from the dominant countries in MSS research.

MSS.xlsx (Section 4.1, page 10): This Excel spreadsheet visualises the keyword search in Section 4.1:

     Lawson: All keywords from reference list of ‘The evolution of mathematics support: a literature review’ - Duncan Lawson, Michael Grove & Tony Croft (2020)
     
     Matthews: All keywords from reference list of ‘Evaluation of mathematics support centres: a literature review’ - Janette Matthews, Tony Croft, Duncan Lawson & Dagmar Waller (2013)
     
     Mullen: All keywords from reference list of 'A scoping literature review of the impact and evaluation of mathematics and statistics support in higher education’ - Claire Mullen, Emma Howard & Anthony Cronin (2024)
               
     Journals + Conferences: All keywords from sources outlined in Section 4.1., pages 8 and 9
    
     Database: All keywords from database search using the search string in Appendix C, p. C.1
    
     Summary: The results from the keyword search
    
     Terminology Sampling: The sources used to perform thematic analysis, using a random sample of 2 per country

     *Note that blank yellow lines represent duplicates, which have been omitted, apart from the Terminology Sampling sheet, where yellow highlighting indicates that the source has been selected for thematic analysis.


Survey.xlsx (Section 5, page 13): These are the aggregated survey results from 39 respondents:

    Demographics: This presents the country, language, and experience breakdown of the participants.

    Collaboration: This quantifies the level of national and international collaboration, as well as awareness of various sources of MSS research.

    Keywords: This measures the use of keywords in identifying research, and the preferences of MSS researchers to two types of keywords: 'Support' Keywords and Additional Keywords.

    Terminology: This describes participants' attitudes towards the level of standardisation in MSS terminology, and their use or awareness of various terms under the themes identifed in the Thematic Analysis in Section 4.2: Physical Centres, Personnel, Methods, Research Topics, Tools/Techniques.


Terminology.docx (Section 4.2, page 11): This document shows the themes and phrases extracted from the thematic analysis in Section 4.2.
